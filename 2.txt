Text Analysis Project Sample

Text analysis is an important part of computer science and data processing.
It helps people understand large amounts of text quickly and effectively.
By counting word frequency, we can discover the most important keywords in a document.

This sample text is written in English to avoid encoding problems.
The program reads a text file, processes the content, and counts how many times each word appears.
Words such as analysis, text, and program may appear many times.

This project is suitable for students who are learning Python programming.
It uses basic techniques such as file reading, string processing, and data visualization.
With a simple graphical user interface, users can easily interact with the program.

In conclusion, text analysis is a useful and practical application of Python.
